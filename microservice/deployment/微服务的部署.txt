微服务的五种部署方式 https://semaphoreci.com/blog/deploy-microservices
1. Single machine, multiple processes:
   Buy or rent a server and run the microservices as processes.

2. Multiple machines, multiple processes:
   The obvious next step is adding more servers and distributing the load,
   offering more scalability and availability.

3. Containers:
   Packaging the microservices inside a container makes it easier to deploy.
   Run along with other services. It’s also the first step towards Kubernetes.

4. Orchestrator:
   Orchestrators such as Kubernetes or Nomad are complete platforms designed
   to run thousands of containers simultaneously.

5. Serverless:
   Serverless allows us to forget about processes, containers, and servers,
   and run code directly in the cloud.
